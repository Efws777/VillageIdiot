      <h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
      <p>The goal of the game is to get rid of all your cards, and the last person to get rid of their cards is the “Village Idiot”. 
        Each player has to play a higher card than the person before them. You can play cards of the same rank (number) as the person before you. 
        If you cannot play on a card, you must pick up the whole discard pile. You can also play more than one card of the same rank (number) but 
        you do not have to.</p>
        
        <p> Aces are high and there are special cards: </p>
        <ul>
        <li>2s - you can play this on anything, and you can play anything on a 2. Basically acts as a reset back to low cards.</li>
        <li>10s - can be played on anything, clears the discard pile (moved off to the side) and the player who played the 10 gets to go again.</li>
        <li>7s - have to be played in order (can play on 6 or lower), and the next person has to play less than a 7 (not including 7).</li>
        <li>8s - have to be played in order, they skip the next person. If you play more than one, skips the next that many people</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The game is played with 2 or 3 players. To set up the game, each player is given 3 cards facedown, 3 cards face-up, and 3 cards for their 
        hand. Play moves clockwise. If you have less than 3 cards after your turn, you draw 
        from the draw pile until you have 3 cards again. If you have more than 3 cards, you do not draw. </p>
        
        <p>You keep playing until you get rid of all the cards in your hand, then you pick up the three faceup cards. 
        Once you have no more cards in your hand again, you flip over the facedown cards one at a time and it is up to chance whether it is higher 
        than the card that's on top of the pile. If it is lower, you must pick up the pile and get rid of those cards before flipping over another facedown 
        card. Play continues until someone runs out of cards, and they win.
        </p>
